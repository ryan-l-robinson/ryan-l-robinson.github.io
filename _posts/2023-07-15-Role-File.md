A while ago [I wrote about](/websites/drupal/drupal-assign-permissions-based-on-username-file/), and shared [sample code for](https://github.com/ryan-l-robinson/drupal-permissions-from-file), adding a role to a user when they log in if their name appears in a file on the server. That was a Drupal 7 sample.

I've now updated that for Drupal 9 and created a project in my GitHub. It's relatively straightforward and the same idea as before, so I won't provide a line by line breakdown again.
