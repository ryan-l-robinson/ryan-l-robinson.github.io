Over the last few months, I’ve been working on preparing for [the MS-101 exam](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/ms-101). This exam covers a few topics around enterprise device management and security. I’ve mostly been studying with a few methods:

- The [official practice test from MeasureUp](https://www.measureup.com/ms-101-microsoft-365-mobility-and-security.html)
- Reading the learning paths from Microsoft
- Reading [a prep booklet from Nate Chamberlain](https://www.packtpub.com/product/microsoft-365-mobility-and-security-exam-guide-ms-101/9781838984656)
- Trying as much as I can in my personal tenant with license trials, or a dev tenant, but some things can be hard to test out without significant amounts of real data and users

I’m adding another piece: writing about it. One of the best ways to learn something is to try to explain to somebody else in your own words. So with that, I’m starting a new series on what I’m learning as I study for the MS-101.
