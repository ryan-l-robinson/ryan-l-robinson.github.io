In doing research on accessibility tools that could be incorporated into a Drupal site, a co-worker recommended [Fluid UI](https://fluidproject.org/). This is not the same Fluid Framework used by Microsoft as the backbone of [the new Microsoft Loop tool](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-introduces-loop-a-new-collaboration-tool-built-on-fluid-framework/), or [the Fluent UI Microsoft design language](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui). There’s lots of use of Fluid and Fluent out there.

This one is an open source group out of Toronto focused on web accessibility, and they offer their tools in a few different formats. One is as [a convenient Drupal module](https://www.drupal.org/project/fluidui). I installed it on a dev site and took a look at what it offered.

## The toolbar

It creates a toolbar across the top of the site, hidden by default behind a “+ Show Preferences” button. When expanded, there are a few options which can be valuable accessibility improvements.

_The toolbar with the 5 components_

- Change font size or spacing between lines
- Change to a high-contrast colour palette
- Emphasize links and buttons
- Display a table of contents

The only one I don’t quite understand the value of is the table of contents. It gives a bland unstyled list of links, programmatically generated based on the headers on the page. I’m not sure who this is for. Sighted users can see the headers. Blind or low-vision users can navigate in a screen reader by the header levels already, much more useful than a table of contents at the top. I assume there is a use case because these developers know a lot more about accessibility than I do, but I have failed to think of what it is. Feel free to comment if you know.

It’s also a bit odd visually, needing to scroll sideways to see all the options. I’d like to think there would be a better way to display them all.

## Configuration

It has limited admin configuration options both around what pages the toolbox should appear on:

- Display on admin pages (yes/no checkbox). By default this is off, meaning it only shows on the public pages, but if you’re aiming to improve accessibility of administration as well, you’ll want to turn this on.
- Hide the toolbox on these pages (text area to specify pages). There might be some unique pages where it doesn’t work very well, so you can name those as exceptions.

I am a little tempted to come up with a basic settings page that can turn on or off each component, instead of it being an all-or-nothing, and maybe be able to change the order of the components, then offer that back to the developers. It’s not a big need, though; most are going to be happy with leaving everything on.

## Conclusion

Overall, it’s a good tool. It is a little rough, so I do hope they smooth it out some more, but it’s certainly much better than not offering these accessibility improvements at all.
