This week I completed a new certification! I am now Microsoft certified as a [Power Platform App Maker Associate,](https://www.credly.com/badges/f62e6037-44d4-4ee2-9fd8-a83b84500910/public_url), having completed [the PL-100 exam](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/pl-100). This covers a lot of the introductory understanding of the Power Platform including Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, and Power Virtual Agent. There's a lot of great tools in here and I'm happy that I've gotten a good introductory grasp of them.

It is listed on the [about page](/about) along with my other certifications.
