I recently learned about a new framework for a fully HTML and CSS implementation of Microsoft’s Fluent Design system. This can make your life a lot easier when designing web apps that stick to that design. I haven’t tried it out yet – I’m hoping to get a full SharePoint Framework experiment together soon – but it looks very promising.

Here are some key links to help:

- [Adding HTwoO to a React SharePoint Framework web part](https://n8d.at/how-to-use-htwoo-with-a-reactjs-web-part/?utm_source=collab365&utm_medium=collab365today&utm_campaign=daily_digest)
