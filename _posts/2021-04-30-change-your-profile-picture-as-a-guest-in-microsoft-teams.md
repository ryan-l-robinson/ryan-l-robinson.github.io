If you’ve operated as a guest in a different company’s Microsoft Teams tenant, you may have noticed that you don’t get the same user photo that you do in your own tenant. Instead, you only get your initials in a colour background. If you’re signing in as a guest regularly in a different tenant, that can get a bit annoying. There’s no clear interface option to change it either.

Fortunately, [Yannick Reekmans has found a way to do it and detailed it in his blog](https://blog.yannickreekmans.be/change-own-profile-picture-as-guest-in-microsoft-teams/). I won’t cover all the steps here and I have not personally tried it yet, but this sounds like it would be worth it – at least for those of us who are comfortable looking at developer tools in our browser. Check out the details there and let me know if it works for you.
