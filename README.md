## Overview

My personal landing page for ryanrobinson.ca. It is a single purely HTML and CSS page.

## Status

I am currently happy with the header and footer, but I am still tinkering with the main content. I have now tried collapsing it into one column for work (technology) and one for everything else, including the theology blog link. That feels like a better approach than having four sections, which I tried but felt like it minimized the tech portion too much and added more than really needed to be there.

At minimum I still need to do:

- Add a photo for not work, maybe the one of me with Ciri on my shoulder
- Add some border separation between the two sections
