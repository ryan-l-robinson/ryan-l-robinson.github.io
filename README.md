## Overview

My personal landing page for ryanrobinson.ca. It is a single purely HTML and CSS page.

## Status

I am currently happy with the header and footer, but haven't quite decided what to do with the main content yet. The current approach has two columns, one for Technology and one for Theology. However, I still haven't quite sorted out a few things:

1. I want at least one photo, but I can't put a photo in one column without also being in the other (as it currently has) because that looks uneven.
2. I may want another section for other general notes about me: cyclist, movies, cat?
3. Do the sections need more separation to make sure they don't visually blur together? Maybe more of a card style with an outline around each section and a hover effect?
4. "Move Slow and Fix Things" in there somewhere?
